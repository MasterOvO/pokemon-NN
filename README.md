Neural Network practice using pokemon image

This is a record for myself as a first proper project on Deep learning & github.


The repository contains the following:

code -> code for scraping pokemon image data with input national pokedex

pokemon_pic -> a downloaded picture for first 3 gen pokemon

CNN -> a convolutional Neural Network for classifying pokemon type base on the picture

GAN -> a GAN model for generate pokemon image (more epoch should generate better result, I don't have gpu setup)
